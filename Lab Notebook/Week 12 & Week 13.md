# WEEK 12 & WEEK 13

### Deep Analysis based on Merged, filtered, Integrated scATAC-seq dataset

- DAR
- GO
- KEGG
- Main:
  - use of gene-by-cell matrix for Merged and integrated scATAC-seq dataset, split by samples (WT & KD)
  - extract genes that are differentially expressed in Cardiac Cells (vs. the rest) for two samples
  - use those gene lists as inputs for GO and KEGG
