Reading List:

- [ChIP-R: Assembling reproducible sets of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq peaks from multiple replicates](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.396960v1.supplementary-material)

**2021.02.23 Tue**


- zoom meeting with Mikael:

  - Weekly meeting on Tuesday at 2pm Brisbane time
  - aims on "how peak-caller works on scATAC-seq data"
  - general method on the project: define problems => find approaches to solve problems (make hypothesis) => do analysis

  - next week:
    - review papers on scATAC-seq
    - find public scATAC datasets at the beginning (scATAC at developmental stage/one-time points/one-tissue/fully differentiated....)

- Reading List:
  - [Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Cardiac Differentiation from Human PSCs Reveals HOPX- Dependent Cardiomyocyte Maturation](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1934590918304466)
