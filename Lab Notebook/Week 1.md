zoom meeting with Mikael (2021.02.23 Tue) :

- Weekly meeting on Tuesday at 2pm Brisbane time
- project aims on "how peak-caller works on scATAC-seq data"
- general method on the project: define problems => find approaches to solve problems (make hypothesis) => do analysis

- next week:
  - review papers on scATAC-seq
  - find public scATAC datasets at the beginning (scATAC at developmental stage/one-time points/one-tissue/fully differentiated....)
