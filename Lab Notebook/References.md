[Rank products: a simple, yet powerful, new method to detect differentially regulated genes in replicated microarray experiments](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.febslet.2004.07.055)

- identifying differentially expressed genes that does not originate from a sophisticated statistical model but rather from an analysis of biological reasoning
- based on calculating rank products (RP) from replicate experiments
