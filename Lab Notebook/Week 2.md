# WEEK TWO

Zoom Meeting (2020.03.02 Tue): 
- Project aim: 
  - what are the main limitations in current scATAC-seq analysis?
  - for the reproducibility accessment of final peaks, what improvements does Chip-R have (or the adaptation of Chip-R on scATAC-seq data) on the analysis compared to other bioinformatic tools?
  - validation on robustness on clustering of cells
  - methods on cluster 1/2 (or 1/3, 1/4) of cells vs. all cells, analyze reproducibility scores also on the remaining cells
- Next week:
  - run scATAC-seq pipeline on raw data to process peaks
  - cell clustering and visualization
  - access reproducibility of peaks
